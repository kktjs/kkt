Basic Example for Less
===

Use [`Rematch`](https://github.com/rematch/rematch) for the project.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npx create-kkt my-app -e less
cd my-app
npm install
```

**development**

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
npm run start
```

**production**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
